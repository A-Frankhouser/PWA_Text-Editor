# J.A.T.E. - Just Another Text Editor

## Description:
J.A.T.E. or Jate for short, is a simple text editor that operates both in the browser and offline. It features multiple different data persistance techniques and can also be installed! This app can be used both in the browser or on a mobile device!

## Usage:
Jate uses IndexedDB to store and retrieve the data. After you have finished typing and click away, the application automatically sends that data to a database. So even if you close this application and reopen it, the same data will reappear! It also allows you to install it locally, by clicking the install button in the top right hand corner. Once you click on the install button, a windows alert will pop up. This is just a confirmation, just in case you hit the install button by accident! 

## Installation:
To install, first you need to clone this repository to you local device using the `git clone ` command.<br>

Once this is installed locally, you will need to open up the intergrated terminal and type in `npm install`. <br>

The very last step is to now type in `npm run start`. This will build the application and run the server. If you would like to visit it locally, type in `http://localhost:3000` in your web-browser.
